# My DevOps Learning Journey

The course provided a well-rounded approach, blending both theoretical knowledge and practical, hands-on experience that was invaluable for building a strong foundation in DevOps principles and practices. Below is a brief overview of the key topics I explored during this journey:
## üìö Git and GitHub
Although I had worked on Git and Github before, in our first assignment, we were asked to use Pull Requests of Github, so I learned to use Git commands on the terminal. It provided a starting point for learning more Git Hub commands. Now, I have good hands-on practice with version control, code reviews, and GitHub operations. I gained a solid understanding of the core Git concepts, such as branches, merges, and rebates. The practical exercises helped me understand how version control fits into the larger DevOps pipeline.

## üê≥ Docker and Kubernetes
Docker and Kubernetes were crucial topics. I learned how Docker containers simplify application deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies in isolated environments. Along with Docker, I delved into Kubernetes, a powerful orchestration tool for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The most important thing about this was the architecture and behind-the-scenes on how and what docker and Kubernetes work in theory. Moreover, we also learned that Kubernetes documentation is a really, really well-written documentation that can easily explain everything about Kubernetes and container orchestration. 

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS and Terraform
My journey also included extensive learning on Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the leading cloud platforms in the industry. I gained practical experience with various AWS services, such as EC2 and EKS, which are essential for cloud infrastructure management. The main focus was on EKS and creating EC2 instances; these serve as core components for deploying applications on AWS. After that, we touched Terraform to get a sense of Infrastructure as Code. This was meant to automate our AWS processes. 

## üîí Kyverno, Knative and Istio (Service Mesh Architectures)
One of the advanced topics I explored was Service Mesh Architecture, which included tools like Kyverno, Knative, and Istio. I learned how these tools help manage microservices-based architectures, providing policies, traffic management, security, and observability. Kyverno was introduced as a policy engine for Kubernetes, Istio as a robust service mesh for microservices communication, and Knative to simplify the deployment of serverless applications.

## üìä Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus and Grafana are core monitoring tools. As our instructor told us, a good organization cannot survive without monitoring tools. So, these tools are a core concept that is ready to use industry skills. 

## üè¢Industry Knowledge and Acknowledgement 
Finally, I would like to thank my course instructor [Mr. Saim Safdar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saim-safder/) for his contributions to this course and for teaching us with utmost effort. He also introduced us to the CNCF Landscape, which opened a good pathway for us to learn cloud and DevOps technologies.
Moreover, we gained immense industry knowledge from our instructor and learned about the current trends internationally and nationally regarding jobs and businesses in computing and how do these operate by sharing his past experiences with companies and individuals.
